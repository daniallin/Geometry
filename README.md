# A Python Geometry Package
This geometry package was written for performing computational geometry.

This package start with the point. Then establish the line also the segment and ray based on the point. Finally increasing more higher dimensional object: polygon, such as triangles, rectangles.

This project is developed by referring [sympy -> geometry]("https://github.com/sympy/sympy/tree/master/sympy/geometry"). But you didn't need to install sympy when using this package. We deleted unnecessary part of sympy->geometry. You can believe it's a faster geometry package. 

Also, this project is still in progress. It's still a hard work to make this project more completed and more efficient. We will keep trying.

### Tips
- The process directory in the package was used to record tasks that we need to accomplish.
- The test directory in the package was used to test
